Started creation for the game

Basic structures created for:
	Player stats & name
	Enemy stats & names and some generic enemies created
	Gear stat modifiers and some gear names
	Armor is verifiably equippable, *BUT STATS STILL DO NOTHING*
	Inventory function to print out stats of equipped gear created and working, optimized pretty well. print gear function is in gear.c at the bottom.
	
	
**********************************************************************

6/24/16
	Modified character structures, damage stat working properly based on equipped weapon.
	Defense stats working properly based on equipped gear
	HP stats working properly based on equipped gear *NEED A HP COUNTER FOR BATTLE THOUGH*
	

6/26/16
	Began work on giving user ability to change gear.
	Basic inventory is set up, it will hold a max of 200 items. 
	
6/28/16
	Modified user inventory, potions (consumables) can now be consumed and removed from inventory. It will also report how many hp have been healed. WILL NOT OVERHEAL THE USER.
	Armor items in user inventory can be equipped, stats are successfully modified when doing so.
	All items can now be equipped and stats are successfully modified
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
The to do list is getting long, so I want to try to organize this more and break it apart into phases:
PHASE I: 
		Getting all base character functions working (stats, consumables, equipment, exp, etc)
		Getting all base enemy functions working (level scaling, damage, exp, item and gold drops, multiple enemies at once, etc)
		Debugging and actually playing the game by just doing repeated battles and making sure that
			1. EXP is gained, levels are gained, stats are modified
			2. Gold and Items are dropped and added to the users inventory, printable, and modifiable
			3. A kill history list would be AWESOME! DQ! A monster library where they can review what they've killed before! PWN!
			
PHASE II:
		Upgrade to NCurses or if more ambitious SDL. SDL would likely require a massive rewrite, but that's ok! 
		
**************************************************************************************************************		
PHASE 1: NEXT THINGS TO DO AS OF 6.28
	//1. Allow all item types to be changed, not just chest armor
	//1. When Items are equipped, they need to be removed from inventory, likewise, the item that is currently equipped
	//	should be exchanged in THAT EXACT SLOT of the inventory, also, if the currently equipped item is null, nothing should
	//	be placed in the inventory.
		
	2. Add some more gear
	3. Fix item ID table, you can't have all legendary types in the 1xxxx range, how am i supposed to equip them in the right
		position?
	4. Stack consumables into single item locations. Do this whenever though, it seems tricky.
	5. Give all of the gear you've created (including consumables) a gold value that they will get from merchants.
		KEEP VALUES LOW, POTENTIALLY EVEN bronze, silver, gold, plat like WoW. Make gold actually WORTH something.
	6. Still have to have inventory printout as a variable so it only shows the number of items the person has but changes (instead of the fixed 10 we have)
	7. Fix the null item actually showing as null, just have it say "EMPTY" instead.
	8. Fix the item swaps showing null as an item, if the item is null, just do the equip with no prompt. Simple if statement in your gearswap functions will do.
	
	
	
	
TODO: 
	
	//Make it so when gear is changed, the changeGear function examines what is currently being worn and prompts the user if they want to change or not.
	Fix all of the user input shit, the whole buffer ordeal is driving me bat shit insane
	Figure out how to stack potions into a single inventory slot so say item 0 is just light potion(20)
	//"enter 9 to quit" freezes program when browsing equipped gear.
	Make inventory limit character stat actually halt the total number of items he can carry.
	//Need to add an inventory before I can give user ability to change gear.
	//Make is so player can CHANGE equipment, and all stats change immediately.
	//Make the stats of equipped gear actually DO SOMETHING. They are currently not modifying the players stats. 
	Make the PLAYERS STATS actually do something, they only exist in the code but do nothing in the game yet.
	Make ENEMY stats actually do something
	//add gold
	add merchants
	add random item drops
	add randomness to damage and chance to miss based on attack rating
	add chance of critical hit (player and enemy)
	add unidentified items that can roll random (but predicable range) of stats.
	Implement the game in ncurses, even if it is just in plain old text mode. Try to work it up to some kind of rogue like status
	Add more gear
	Make the game have some sort of story.. lol
	
WILL NEED A CURRENT HP VARIABLE TOO, CAN'T JUST CHANGE MAX.
SET UP VITALITY THE SAME WAY YOU HAVE ATK WORKING WITH DAMAGE (to modify HP)

*** I learned through trial and error that I can't reference a char * with a string literal.. i.e.
char * example = "Bacon"
if (example == "Bacon")
	do stuff.
	
	The if statement won't carry out, but you can do 
if (example[0] == 'B')
	WHICH DID WORK for me. 
	
	See the file in misc test files called pointerfun.c, I haven't solved it in a simple manner. May need to go ask on stack exchange, but I'm going
	 to leave it as is since this program reflects our current ability. I will get through the next text book or two and work on CS50 a bit more then 
	 come back and modify the project instead of dwelling.
