Started creation for the game

Basic structures created for:
	Player stats & name
	Enemy stats & names and some generic enemies created
	Gear stat modifiers and some gear names
	Armor is verifiably equippable, *BUT STATS STILL DO NOTHING*
	Inventory function to print out stats of equipped gear created and working, optimized pretty well. print gear function is in gear.c at the bottom.
	
	
**********************************************************************

6/24/16
	Modified character structures, damage stat working properly based on equipped weapon.
	Defense stats working properly based on equipped gear
	HP stats working properly based on equipped gear *NEED A HP COUNTER FOR BATTLE THOUGH*
	

6/26/16
	Began work on giving user ability to change gear.
	Basic inventory is set up, it will hold a max of 200 items. 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
TODO: 
	"enter 9 to quit" freezes program when browsing equipped gear.
	Make inventory limit character stat actually halt the total number of items he can carry.
	//Need to add an inventory before I can give user ability to change gear.
	FOR THE TEXT VERSION WE AT LEAST NEED TO HAVE OUR scanf() and getchars() dumping their buffer because that shit is ANNOYING.
	Make is so player can CHANGE equipment, and all stats change immediately.
	Make the stats of equipped gear actually DO SOMETHING. They are currently not modifying the players stats. 
	Make the PLAYERS STATS actually do something, they only exist in the code but do nothing in the game yet.
	Make ENEMY stats actually do something
	add gold
	add merchants
	add random item drops
	add randomness to damage and chance to miss based on attack rating
	add chance of critical hit (player and enemy)
	add unidentified items that can roll random (but predicable range) of stats.
	Implement the game in ncurses, even if it is just in plain old text mode. Try to work it up to some kind of rogue like status
	Add more gear
	Make the game have some sort of story.. lol
	
WILL NEED A CURRENT HP VARIABLE TOO, CAN'T JUST CHANGE MAX.
SET UP VITALITY THE SAME WAY YOU HAVE ATK WORKING WITH DAMAGE (to modify HP)
