General layout of the game.

The game starts in program.c's main function (obviously).

Main calls hero.c to get users name and then calls it again to generate the characters stats. The characters stats are stored in a struct contained in hero.h

enemy.c / enemy.h contain the games enemies and their stats. The struct used (typedef struct enemy) is in enemy.h. 




LAYOUT:

hero.h
	structure definitions for character stats and character gear and character inventory and the stats they can modify.
	
gear.h / gear.c
	the declarations and stats of all of the games gear. the struct used is in hero.h

inventory.c
	functions to print inventory, equip gear, use items, etc.
